Need to import postman collection to run the service - `https://api.postman.com/collections/31187272-3ca5b5bd-f2d9-419e-9924-b5f877b253c4?access_key=PMAT-01HH2ET51AXYNS66Y840YGEV1W`
Steps -
1 - Clone the project
2 - I have introduced a POST API for creating AddressBook record in DB manually. In this API you have pass the records that you want store in DB
3 - I have also introduced a another POST API for dummy records in AddressBook table in DB.
4 - To search the record I have introduced a GET API in which you pass the name and phone number.
5 - If you are passing one word in name (Atul) it will consider as first name (FName and LName is seperated by space in between (Atul Gupta))
6 - And any parameter is missing it will ignore that check is search request. If you are nor passing any value in query params it will show you all records in DB.

7 - Here I'm using h2 DataBase to store the AddressBook records
8 - to check the DB and Table in DB - you use this endpoint in brower while running the service (http://localhost:8090/h2-console) - Generic H2 (Embedded)
9 - DB login cred - Driver Class : 'org.h2.Driver', JDBC URL : 'jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1', UserName : 'sa' and password : "";
10 - after login the DB you can run the query command to see the records
